Huawei Wireless 5G                          Shanghai

Software Engineer  2022. 5~Present

Designed and Developed 5G feature based on an algorithm to avoid collisions between multiple periodic signals for worldwide RedCap UEs, which improve the success of accessability by 30%.

Performed as a feature owner of a critical feature, reducing the latency of uploading short videos to 10ms, which has been utilized in all the 5G networks of  Chinese mobile and China Unicom in 2024.

During a 3 months business trip in Manila, performed as a 5G technical expert,  my job includes all the deployment, testings and demonstrations of all the 5G commercial features for Globe, which leads to the commercial utilization of these features within XXXXX sites in Philippines, with a commercial contract of XXXM USD.    

Designed and Developed 5G feature based on an algorithm to avoid collisions between two periodic signals for worldwide RedCap UEs by using number theory, in order to improve their robustness to interference by 70%.

Personal Projects

OpenStreetMapRoutePlanner

This project implements a A*  route planner running on OpenStreetMap in C++, similar to what is used on professional router planners like Google Maps.

It can calculate and draw the shortest path from point a to point b.

Technologies: c++, Algorithms Design,  OOP, cmake

c++ implementations of Classic Data Structures and Algorithms

Right now this project includes the implementation of the most classic data structures, such as red-black tree, AVL tree, max-heap, and hash tables based on random hashing.

Technologies: c++, Algorithms Design
